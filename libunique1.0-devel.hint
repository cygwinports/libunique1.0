ldesc: "Unique is a library for writing single instance application. If 
you launch a single instance application twice, the second instance 
will either just quit or will send a message to the running instance. 
Unique makes it easy to write this kind of applications, by providing a 
base class, taking care of all the IPC machinery needed to send 
messages to a running instance, and also handling the startup 
notification side."
